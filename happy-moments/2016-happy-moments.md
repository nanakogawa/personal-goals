Today is such a big day (to me)! I decided to listen to podcasts instead of music during work! It was my first time ever listening to podcasts. I love Codepen and this was their lastest podcast that they had up, so I decided to try it out! [Codepen - 089: Knowledge Management](https://blog.codepen.io/2016/05/10/089-knowledge-management/). I started logging them [here](https://github.com/nanakogawa/personal-goals/blob/master/resources/podcasts.md).

Tonight was the first [OCCS](https://www.orangecountycodeschool.com/) alumni only meetup! It's going to be held every Thursday, which I'm very excited about! The instructor from [OCCS](https://www.orangecountycodeschool.com/) will present mini introductions to new technologies and provide networking time with our fellow alumnis! Tonight, he introduced us to [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)! & I went to [Roasting Waters](https://www.yelp.com/biz/roasting-water-fountain-valley-2) (again) afterwards..! Yuuum.

I had lunch at [Taco Maria](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-maria-costa-mesa) with my boyfriend & Mona! It was *sooo* good! Also, today marks my 2 week post surgery, so I was allowed back at the gym! Yaaas! I am only allowed to do cardio (which I hate.. favor the least) for the next 2 weeks before I get back into weight lifting again. Nevertheless to say, I'm excited to be back and burn some calories!

I went on a freaking helicopter today for my first time!! We flew over the coast of Orange County and over these beautiful neighborhoods and streets. He did this very frightening thing where we were at about 1000ft over the water and he dropped 600ft like a roller coaster. Then another 200 from there. It was scary but so fun much!! I had such an amazing time.

We had the movers come in in the morning and clear out our apartment. It was one of those happy and sad at the same time type of moments watching the room become more empty. We had lunch at [Cucina Enoteca](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cucina-enoteca-irvine-3), which was super! Started on some tutorials on ReactJS afterwards!
