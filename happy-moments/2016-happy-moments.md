Today is such a big day (to me)! I decided to listen to podcasts instead of music during work! It was my first time ever listening to podcasts. I love Codepen and this was their lastest podcast that they had up, so I decided to try it out! [Codepen - 089: Knowledge Management](https://blog.codepen.io/2016/05/10/089-knowledge-management/). I started logging them [here](https://github.com/nanakogawa/personal-goals/blob/master/resources/podcasts.md).

Tonight my boyfriend and I went to a new restaurant called [Vaca](https://www.yelp.com/biz/vaca-costa-mesa) for dinner and [Roasting Water](https://www.yelp.com/biz/roasting-water-fountain-valley-2) for dessert. The aged beef and oxtail was superb!

Tonight was the first [OCCS](https://www.orangecountycodeschool.com/) alumni only meetup! It's going to be held every Thursday, which I'm very excited about! The instructor from [OCCS](https://www.orangecountycodeschool.com/) will present mini introductions to new technologies and provide networking time with our fellow alumnis! Tonight, he introduced us to [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)! & I went to [Roasting Waters](https://www.yelp.com/biz/roasting-water-fountain-valley-2) (again) afterwards..! Yuuum.

I had lunch at [Taco Maria](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-maria-costa-mesa) with my boyfriend & Mona! It was *sooo* good! Also, today marks my 2 week post surgery, so I was allowed back at the gym! Yaaas! I am only allowed to do cardio (which I hate.. favor the least) for the next 2 weeks before I get back into weight lifting again. Nevertheless to say, I'm excited to be back and burn some calories!
