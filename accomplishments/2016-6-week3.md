### Week in Review
I have been slacking, yes. I am very disappointed in myself, but I can't beat myself up for it. I promised myself to always stay positive, no matter what. I've been staying later at work, going to the gym more often and been distracted with this whole car buying situation. I NEED to step up my game and I can only try harder. Tomorrow is a fresh new week and I won't let the heat nor life get in my way of my productivity.
