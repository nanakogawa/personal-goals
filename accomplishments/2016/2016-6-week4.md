### Week in Review
I am happy I finally started to set up my new project [Parfait](https://github.com/nanakogawa/parfait). However it took a while though because I wanted to make sure I use the right frameworks, templating engines, and etc.

My weekend was super busy, I actually spent a lot of my time with my friends, which I don't do often. So that was really fun. We went to the beach, had all sorts of yummy food and shopping. I'm going to SF for my birthday next weekend, but hopefully I can get a lot of things done on the to-do list next week!
