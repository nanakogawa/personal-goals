### Week in Review
Preparing for the move was very hectic, so I didn't get much done this week. But I am glad I spent time with my boyfriend and close friends to enjoy his last moments in Orange County!

At work, we got a new client that had his application built in ReactJS and my boss happened to hand me that project (YES), so I started learning ReactJS & Sass.
