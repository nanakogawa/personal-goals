### Week in Review
This week consisted of late nights at work and gym. I had in mind for a lot of the tasks to be started on the weekend. But life happens and my dad told me I need to buy a new car! The car I currently drive is old and needs a lot of attention. Since I am moving to NorCal, my dad will not be there to check up on the car, therefor, he wants me to buy a newer and reliable car. That pretty much distracted me all weekend test driving a ton of cars and consulting.

Work was great this week. Knocked out the tasks I needed to do on this new React project and the client was super happy with it! So in result, he will continue work with us. Also, I moved back in with my parents' house till I move to NorCal and i am totally feeling the 'Home Sweet Home'! Going to push myself more next week!!
